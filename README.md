# Project 2 - Samurai's Code - Castle Journal

# 100-famous-castles
In 2006, The Japanese Castle Association released a guide book including the Top 100 Japanese castles to visit. This book enables you to collect stamps from each castle adventure you embark on. However, the guide book is written entirely in Japanese. Our application, Castle Journal, is an English companion app for the guide book. You can Use Castle Journal to assist in adequately planning your trip, share your experiences, and update an online version of your stamp book with the stamps you've collected.
When visiting one of Japan's famous castles, you can apply a unique rubber stamp to your notebook. Use this application to prepare for a trip, read and write reviews, and learn fun facts on your journey to collect all 100 stamps.

# Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
